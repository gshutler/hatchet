require 'logger'

module Hatchet

  # Public: Class that handles logging calls and distributes them to all its
  # appenders.
  #
  # Each logger has 5 logging methods. Those are, in decreasing order of
  # severity:
  #
  #  * fatal
  #  * error
  #  * warn
  #  * info
  #  * debug
  #
  # All these methods have the same signature. You can either provide a message
  # as a direct string, or as a block to the method is lazily evaluated (this is
  # the recommended option).
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   log.info "Informational message"
  #   log.info { "Informational message #{potentially_expensive}" }
  #
  # It is also possible to pass an error to associate with a message. It is down
  # to the appender what it will do with the error (such as including the stack
  # trace) so it is recommended you still include basic information within the
  # message you pass.
  #
  # Examples
  #
  #   log.error "Something bad happened - #{error.message}", error
  #
  # Log messages are sent to each appender where they will be filtered and
  # invoked as configured.
  #
  # Each logger also has 5 inspection methods. Those are, in decreasing order of
  # severity:
  #
  #  * fatal?
  #  * error?
  #  * warn?
  #  * info?
  #  * debug?
  #
  # All these methods take no arguments and return true if any of the loggers'
  # appenders will log a message at that level for the current context,
  # otherwise they will return false.
  #

      # Public: Logs a message at the given level.
      #
      # message - An already evaluated message, usually a String (default: nil).
      # error   - An error which is associated with the message (default: nil).
      # block   - An optional block which will provide a message when invoked.
      #
      # One of message or block must be provided. If both are provided then the
      # block is preferred as it is assumed to provide more detail.
      #
      # In general, you should use the block style for any message not related
      # to an error. This is because any unneccessary String interpolation is
      # avoided making unwritten debug calls, for example, less expensive.
      #
      # When logging errors it is advised that you include some details of the
      # error within the regular message, perhaps the error's message, but leave
      # the inclusion of the stack trace up to your appenders and their
      # formatters.
      #
      # Examples
      #
      #   debug { "A fine grained message" }
      #   info  { "An interesting message" }
      #   warn  { "A message worth highlighting" }
